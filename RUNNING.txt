Assuming that you have a binary of OpenDash for whatever your target platform, now you must do a couple things to get it to run:

edit config.xml.  Read the skinning/configuring tutorial at:
http://th0mas.xbox-scene.com/releases/skinning.html .  The part you care about is the second half, about configuring the menu and the dialog.

edit skin.pth.  If you're building for the xbox, it should be an explicit path:
d:/skin/skin1/

(that is, it is in the form drive:/directory/containing/skin/).  Therefore "drive:/directory/containing/skin/skin.xml" should exist.

Otherwise it should probably look like:
skin/skin1/

If you want to, it could point to a explicit path, like /home/user/skins/skin2 or c:/opendash/skin1 or something.

When you run the binary, it will look for both "config.xml" and "skin.pth" in it's current directory (no matter if running on xbox or computer).

Enjoy.  Read the above skinning tutorial for skinning and configuring.
